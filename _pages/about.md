<!-- About Me
===== -->
I am a first year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) and [Computer Science (CS)](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at [The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/). Currently, I am conducting research in the Computational Imaging & Mixed Representation Labortory, aka., [WeLight@HKU](https://hku.welight.fun/) led by [Dr. Evan Peng](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~evanpeng/).

I completed my bachelor's degree in Physics (with a minor in Computer Science), under the guidance of [Prof. Ligang Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/), at [the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), and further pursued a master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of Dr. Evan Peng. Additionally, I gained valuable experience as a Research Assistant at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), where I was led by [Prof. Bedrich Benes](https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/bbenes/) for a period of two years.

My current academic interests revolve around the areas of Holography, Optics, Computer Graphics, and Virtual/Augmented Reality. You can find my CV [here](https://hku.welight.fun/wenbin/files/CV_ZHOU Wenbin.pdf).
